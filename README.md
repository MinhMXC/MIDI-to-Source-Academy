# MIDI-to-Source-Academy
A Python script that convert Type 0 MIDI file to Source Academy codes

Note: 
This only works with Type 0 MIDI file and 1 instrument. 
You may also need to add more Meta Event support (there are a lot), I only included basic ones. 
I download simple MIDI files from OpenSequencer, so I recommend you get your files there to ensure best result.

How to use:
1. Clone the Repository into your Python IDE
2. Copy your MIDI file into the Project and change the name of the file in the script.
3. Provided are example supported MIDI files and its expected output.
